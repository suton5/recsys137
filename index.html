                <span><b>Problem statement</b></span>
                <p>Music recommenders systems (MRS) have exploded in popularity thanks to music streaming services like
                    Spotify, Pandora, and Apple Music. More than half of current music consumption is
                    by way of these services. While recommender systems have been around for some time and are
                    well researched, music recommender systems differ from their more common siblings in some
                    characteristically important ways: the duration of the items is less (3-5 minutes for a song vs 90
                    minutes for a movie or months/years for a book or shopping item), the items are consumed in
                    sequence with multiple items consumed in a session, repeated recommendations have a different
                    significance since listening to the same song as part of a different playlist may be ok, and
                    consumption often occurs passively as background as music. Music Recommender Systems then require
                    different approaches from traditional recommender systems.</p>
                <p>
                    One of the major problems in Music Recommender Systems is the station/playlist generation problem.
                    At its heart, playlist generation is about finding a set of songs to recommend to best extend
                    the experience of a listener in the midst of a playlist. By suggesting appropriate songs to add to a
                    playlist, a Recommender System can increase user engagement by making playlist creation easier,
                    as well as extending listening beyond the end of the existing playlist.</p>
                <p>One of Spotify’s primary products is Playlists, collections of tracks that individual users (or
                    Spotify)
                    can build for every mood or event. Spotify users can make or follow as many playlists as they
                    like. With over 50 million tacks available, the company attempts to direct the most relevant songs
                    to users based on their preferences, and Playlists often comprise the most convenient and effective
                    way to convey these recommended songs to users.
                    Spotify participates in the creation and curation of Playlists that are followed by millions of
                    Spotify users. These Playlists are compiled in a complex manner, involving both human-led and
                    computer-led processes. What stands is that algorithmically-curated discovery playlists, and their
                    effectiveness, remain an important business interest for the company. The goal is to better
                    understand how these algorithms can be evaluated and improved with machine learning techniques
                    learned in the class.</p>
                <span><b>Project Goal</b></span>
                <p>Automatic Playlist Generation — create a model for song discovery on the basis of the
                    base playlist and user/context information that might be important to the quality of the
                    playlist. Some of user/context information might include intent, emotion, location, playlist
                    "purpose" (driving/road trip, studying, etc). Use the developed model(s) for automatic
                    playlist generation.</p>
                <p>
                    Cold Start Problem — A variant of the problem of automatic playlist generation, the cold start
                    problem involves creating a model to find a good choice of songs for new playlists with relatively
                    few
                    prior playlist entries.
