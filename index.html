                <p>Based on the project goals set out by the AC209a instructors, we are to create a Spotify recommender
                    system that can achieve the following two competencies: (1) automatic playlist generation; (2)
                    deal with the Cold Start problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To this effect, our team has developed a product that utilizes data science models and approaches to
                    create a
                    system with the following functionalities: (1) the system is capable of taking in single-song
                    inputs and generating in-app playlists on Spotify; (2) the system can take in ‘intent’ and/or
                    ‘mood’ inputs and generate playlists corresponding to said intents without any song input.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team believes that such a system would adequately address both project goals and create
                    the necessary foundation on which more sophisticated recommender systems can be built.
                    Our project website charts our approach and model design process and will chiefly discuss
                    our data collection and analysis procedure as well as our how we arrived at our final models.
                    Subsequently, we evaluate the success and weaknesses of our model before concluding with some
                    discussion of future possible extensions to our system. All scripts and code referenced in our
                    website are available in our project notebook and our project repository.

                <span><b>Background</b></span>
                <p>In early 2018, Reuters reported that based on findings by the IFPI’s Global Music Report, <a
                        href="https://www.reuters.com/article/music-sales/music-streaming-overtakes-physical-sales-for-the-first-time-industry-body-idUSL8N1S143H">music
                    streaming has, for the first time, overtaken traditional music sales to become the music industry’s
                    largest single revenue source</a>.
                    A vital component of such music streaming services is the use of music recommender systems (MRS)
                    that encourage exploration, discovery, and even more music consumption.
                    These MRS face unique constraints and challenges that set it apart from traditional recommender
                    systems; two objectives that were posed to our team were (1) creating a system of automatic
                    playlist generation through intent/mood; (2) dealing with the ‘Cold Start’ problem faced by MRS.
                </p>
                <br>
                <span><b>Challenges</b></span>
                <p>
                    As such, our team’s primary aim is to address the twin objectives and, in doing so,
                    develop our own MRS that should integrate seamlessly with the Spotify platform.

                    Our primary challenges involve using the limited data we have to generate sensible
                    recommendations that are relevant and sufficiently random (in order to maintain an
                    explorative element). Another challenge is to find a way to relate our data to user
                    intent/moods and develop metrics to assess the accuracy of our model given the existing data
                    constraints.
                    An additional challenge is to create an interface and method of communication that is intuitive,
                    user-friendly, and flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of use cases.
                    These challenges are more clearly articulated in the subsequent sections where we detail our
                    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and our baseline model.

<section class="page-section" id="data">

                <span><b>Data Description</b></span>
                <p>
                    The primary dataset that we obtained through the AC209a instructors is the Million Playlist
                    dataset released by Spotify as part of the 2018 Recsys challenge. Based on our preliminary
                    examination of the data, we notice that the data does not contain any information on the
                    structural features of tracks nor any user input beyond the inclusion of songs in certain playlists.
                    Our knowledge of MRS informed us that there was very little we could do with the base data alone;
                    we needed a means to tease out user input or feedback (to train our model on) and obtain song
                    features that could be mapped into certain classifications for our recommender system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As such, this motivated our data collection efforts that we detail below; we ended up
                    obtaining two primary datasets for our system:
                <ul>
                    <li>An augmented dataset based on the Million Playlist dataset</li>
                    <li>Public domain Spotify playlists made by users.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <br>
                <span><b>Data Collection</b></span>
                <p>
                    The initial dataset contained a set of playlists with the features listed below but little in the
                    way of information about the tracks themselves beyond their membership in a particular playlist and
                    the artist and albums they belonged to.
                </p>
                Base data features:
                <ul class="dual">
                    <li>Playlist ID</li>
                    <li>Position</li>
                    <li>Artist name</li>
                    <li>Track URI</li>
                    <li>Artist URI</li>
                    <li>Track name</li>
                    <li>Album URI</li>
                    <li>Duration (ms)</li>
                    <li>Album name</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We wrote a simple Python script that enabled us to extract additional features from Spotify’s API
                    by feeding in the unique track identification codes and requesting song features. For this, we
                    relied on Spotipy (a Python package that enabled easy interaction with Spotify’s API) along with
                    other common Python packages.
                    Subsequently, we created an augmented dataset that extends our initial set of songs from the
                    Million Playlist Dataset by including additional features we’ve extracted from the Spotify API.
                    This was then stored in a SQLite database for easy querying.
                </p>
                Augmented data features:
                <ul class="dual">
                    <li>Danceability</li>
                    <li>Energy</li>
                    <li>Key</li>
                    <li>Loudness</li>
                    <li>Mode</li>
                    <li>Speechiness</li>
                    <li>Acousticness</li>
                    <li>Instrumentalness</li>
                    <li>Liveness</li>
                    <li>Valence</li>
                    <li>Tempo</li>
                    <li>Type</li>
                    <li>Analysis URL</li>
                    <li>Time signature</li>
                </ul>
                Detailed explanation of these features are available on the <a
                    href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference-beta/#endpoint-get-several-audio-features!">Spotify
                developer page</a>.
                <p>
                    For our second set of data, we relied on a separate Python script that scraped existing
                    user-generated
                    playlists on Spotify and returned TSV files containing Track Titles, Artist Names, Album Titles,
                    and the relevant id codes. We used this script to scrape playlists that corresponded to each of
                    the four moods/intents that we sought to model and we ran the collected data through the API once
                    again to populate our data with Spotify’s audio features. We curated these playlists by
                    qualitatively considering how well the playlists align to the specific moods, assessing
                    the number of playlist followers, and ensuring that the tracks were largely released prior
                    to 2018 (such that the songs from these playlists also feature on our Million Playlist dataset).
                    The playlists are stored in our data folder within our main repository.
                </p>
                Moods/Intents curated:
                <ul class="dual">
                    <li>Angry</li>
                    <li>Sad</li>
                    <li>Party</li>
                    <li>Sleep</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <span><b>Exploratory Data Analysis</b></span>
                <p>
                    Both datasets are similar in the features; the key difference in the second dataset that we scraped
                    is that the playlists reference specific moods and intents that we curated. We will now discuss our
                    EDA that we performed on our primary dataset since the process is similar. The following plots are
                    generated from the 'songs620.csv' file and the code used to generate the plots are in our notebook.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We first plot a scatter matrix to assess for correlation across all of the features that we gathered
                    from the Spotify API for the ‘songs620.csv’ dataset that we assumed to be representative of the
                    other
                    CSVs. We viewed this assumption to be fair because of how each dataset contains a large number of
                    observations.
                </p>

                <div class="figure-img">

                    <b>Figure 1: Scatter Matrix for Spotify's Audio Features (songs620.csv)</b>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    From our visual inspection, it seems like features such as energy and loudness seem to exhibit
                    multicollinearity. We can choose to deal with this by either dropping one of the attributes or
                    by downscaling one; alternatively, we could perform more rigorous assessments of the features
                    in order to understand which combination of weights for the features will generate the best
                    most intuitively sensible recommendations.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Subsequently, we standardized our data and computed the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) vectors
                    so as
                    to visualize the component pairs through another scatter matrix. This gave us some insight
                    concerning
                    the number of clusters we might expect in the data.
                </p>
                <br>
                <div class="figure-img">
                    <img src="img/Figure_2_PCA_Scatter_Matrix.png" style="width: 100%">

                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    From our PCA we observe roughly 3 clusters, and can now fit these using K-means to get some
                    intuition.
                    We note that the learned cluster centers correspond correctly to the 3 clusters we visually saw in
                    the PCA projections.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    This concludes our initial EDA. We note that some of the Spotify features seem to be highly
                    correlated;
                    we also identify potential clusters that will give us some insight into how we should design our
                    baseline model. We now consider the relevant literature surrounding recommender systems in order to
                    develop our baseline model.

                <span><b>Model</b></span>

                <p>
                    Given out lack of experience with recommender models, we cast a particularly wide net in the
                    early stages of our project and implemented a number of distinct models. For instance, after
                    reading A Novel Hybrid Music Recommendation System using K-Means Clustering and PLSA by Gurpreet
                    Singh and Rajdavinder Singh Boparai, we
                    implemented K Means clustering as part of our EDA. The model implemented on Singh & Boparai
                    is based strictly on what songs users play, and as we explored the Spotify API and found that
                    we could extract a number metrics beyond just playlist content (e.g. tempo, danceability) for every
                    song,
                    and thus decided to look elsewhere. Moreover, when the K means clustering model was compared to the
                    gaussian mixture model we also implemented,
                    we found k means clustering provided a less rigorous probabilistic framework than the GMM. This
                    GMM was implemented, in part, based on the findings of Rui Chen, Qingyi Hua, Quanli Gao, and Ying
                    Xing, in "A Hybrid Recommender System for Gaussian Mixture Model
                    and Enhanced Social Matrix Factorization Technology Based on
                    Multiple Interests",
                    though, as with the previous article, this system was based strictly on preferences
                    and was not as low-level as our ideal model.

                    Our use of track features in our model is informed by Berenzweig et al.’s 2003 discussion of
                    acoustic features and their limitations. These insights influenced how we fed these values into
                    our nearest-neighbours model

                <p>
                    Our metric used to assess our model’s performance is guided by the concepts discussed in Maeleb’s
                    Medium article Recall and Precision at k for Recommender Systems. We considered a similar method
                    of evaluating our recommendation accuracy.

                <span><b>Spotify API</b></span>
                <p>

                    Our code that interacts with Spotify’s API references the documentation and sample code provided by
                    the Spotify Developer documentation page.
                    Additionally, we referenced Casey Chu’s public domain code that used the Spotipy package.

                        <p>The Cold Start problem refers to the issue where a system cannot draw any inferences for
                            users or items about which it has not yet gathered sufficient information.</p>
                        <p>In the context of our project, the issue concerns how we can create a model that is able to
                            make sound song recommendations for new playlists with relatively few prior user inputs.
                            This would involve the user essentially feeding in perhaps 3 or so songs that they like.</p>
                        <p>In our case, we have designed our baseline model to take in a single song input in order to
                            generate a playlist of recommended songs solely based on the inputted song. Note that when a
                            user indicates that they like a song, we only focus on the set of playlists that the song is
                            a part of. We can then generate recommendations using techniques like:</p>

                            not exactly correspond to a song, we can use our pre-trained NN to find the closest match.
                            This method requires us to select the number of clusters we expect in the data. We can
                            select this using a combination of the Silhouette score and Bayesian Information Criterion.
                            We demonstrate these on a subset of the data below.

                <span><b>Project Trajectory</b></span>
                <P>
                    Initially, our focus was mainly on the Cold Start problem and how this might be resolved. Our
                    recommendations were entirely based on song inputs and relating these inputs to other songs - in
                    these cases, the mapping of a song input to a recommendation was relatively clear given our model.
                </P>
                <p>
                    Following the third project milestone, we shifted our focus in order to deal with the other goal
                    concerning automatic playlist generation through user context and input beyond song inputs. Rather
                    than attempt to refine our model or find some means of gathering data to evaluate the success of
                    our recommender system, we developed an alternative model that could take in user intent and/or
                    mood and map this input into song recommendations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we made an effort to avoid scope creep and decided against attempting to generate
                    a genre map or a refined graphical interface; instead, we chose to focus on refining our recommender
                    systems. Although these implementations would have been great, given the constraints we faced,
                    pursuing those routes would have probably spread us too thin.
                </p>

                <p>
                    TODO; WE NEED MORE FOR ANALYSIS AS WELL BASED ON OUR RESULTS

                <span><b>Analysis and Evaluation</b></span>
                <p>
                    Our team considers the project a broad success - we have met our goals of developing a functioning
                    and accurate recommender system with an impressive array of use cases.
                    Our team believes that our final deliverable definitely meets the project criteria and that we have
                    gone beyond what was expected of us in order to create a product that we are all proud of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although our priorities have definitely shifted in order to meld better with our resources, we made
                    the
                    most of what we had and managed to produce a considerable amount of output. We learnt a lot
                    throughout
                    the course of the project and had the opportunity to apply a lot of what we were taught in AC209a;
                    we also
                    managed to extend our project and incorporate models and approaches beyond our course syllabus.

                <p>
                    A key extension we hope to implement for our recommender system is to incorporate a graphic
                    interface such that our system is more aesthetically appealing and more intuitive for casual users.
                    We want users to be confident in our recommendations and we believe that a strong aesthetic can
                    help to build that confidence. To that extent, we have developed a sample user interface for our
                    existing 4 moods.
                </p>
                <br>
                <div class="figure-img">
                    <img src="img/intent.jpg" style="width: 60%">
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Figure 4: Possible graphical interface</b>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Additionally, we hope to incorporate more intents and moods in our model. We could take a similar
                    approach as we did in our above model to generate these moods and intents; alternatively, we could
                    consider more user-driven approaches and adaptively incorporate moods and intents based on the
                    success of our recommendations or based on user feedback.

                    A more quantitative approach to achieve this could involve a classification model that maps songs
                    to genres, moods, and intents and we can subsequently generate our mood/intent extensions based
                    on the most distinct, well-defined clusters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also hope to create a feedback system where users can either manually rate the quality of the
                    recommendations or we can somehow collect metadata concerning usage and evaluate recommendations
                    there. One possible formulation of this could involve a ‘mulligan’ system where, given an initial
                    user input, we could provide a small set of recommendations (say, five recommendations). The user
                    would then pick which of the recommendations they want to keep and the system would reparameterize
                    based on the user’s choices.
